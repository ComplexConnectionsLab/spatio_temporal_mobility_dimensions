# Spatio-temporal Dimensions of Human Mobility

<p>
  This repository contains the code with the analyses of changes in the time-space dimension of human mobility during the COVID-19 pandemic. To assess these changes,  we employ the radius of gyration as a spatial metric and the mobility synchronisation as a time metric that quantifies the co-temporal occurrence of the daily mobility motifs.
